    scenario 1: Accused early on
action example: "I get why I might seem suspicious, but let’s think this through. A wrong vote now could really set us back. We need more information."

scenario 2: Another werewolf is accused
action example: "Honestly, I’m torn. [Accused Werewolf] could be innocent, but we can’t ignore the possibility. Let’s proceed carefully."

scenario 3: Seen near a victim by Seer/Tracker
action example: "Maybe the Seer saw wrong, or perhaps they’re being tricked. We need to consider all possibilities before making a final decision."

scenario 4: Final three with accusations flying
action example: "It’s tense right now, and I understand the urgency, but we need to make sure we’re not letting emotions cloud our judgment."

scenario 5: Trusted ally is targeted by others
action example: "Let’s not be too quick to throw away strong allies. Sometimes, the quiet players are the real threats. We should reconsider our targets."

scenario 6: Someone claims they saw you transform
action example: "That’s a pretty serious accusation. Are you sure? It could just be a misunderstanding. Let’s think this through."

scenario 7: Caught in a lie about your role
action example: "I might have misspoken, but let’s not focus too much on minor slip-ups. Instead, we should consider who’s been acting inconsistently throughout the game."

    here are some examples:

Situation 1:
Uncover a werewolf but want to stay hidden.
Action: Suggest suspicion subtly and back others’ doubts first.
Optimized Action: "Casually mention doubts about the Werewolf, saying something like, 'Something seems off about [Werewolf’s name],' without revealing specifics. Support others’ suspicions when they align with your findings, letting them take the lead in raising doubts."

Situation 2:
Someone else claims to be Seer.
Action: Judge if outing yourself is worth it; question their accuracy.
Optimized Action: "Assess the other Seer claim carefully. If outing yourself feels necessary, do so cautiously by pointing out specific information only you would know. If you stay hidden, throw gentle doubt on their accuracy with comments like, 'That doesn’t quite match what I’ve seen,' to weaken their credibility."

Situation 3:
Reveal yourself and worry about targeting.
Action: Seek doctor protection or encourage hunting down wolves swiftly.
Optimized Action: "Reveal your role clearly and calmly, requesting support from protective roles like the Doctor, and encourage the group to act quickly to eliminate remaining threats. Suggest focusing on evidence and efficiency to make the best use of your information."
